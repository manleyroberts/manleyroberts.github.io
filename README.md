## Manley Roberts

Hello, I'm Manley. I'm a research scientist at [Abacus.AI](https://abacus.ai/), working on research in (mostly) robustness of modern LLMs. Previously, I completed my MS in Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University while conducting research in the [ACMI Lab](https://acmilab.org/), and prior to that my BS in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.
